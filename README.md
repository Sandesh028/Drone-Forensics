# Drone Forensics: Understanding and Analyzing UAV Data

## Overview
This session introduces students to the field of drone forensics, focusing on extracting, decoding, and analyzing flight data. Through a combination of demonstrations and hands-on exercises, students will learn how to reconstruct flight paths and identify potential forensic artifacts in UAV systems.

## Key Takeaways
- **Forensic Foundations**: Learn the basics of drone forensic investigations.
- **Practical Exposure**: Perform forensic analysis of flight logs and data.
- **Application of Tools**: Use Python scripts and visualization tools like Google Earth.

## What You Will Learn
- How to extract flight logs from drones or data storage systems.
- Techniques for decoding flight data to uncover insights.
- Methods to map flight paths using KML files and Google Earth.

## Agenda
1. **Introduction**: Overview of forensic principles applied to drones.
2. **Live Demonstration**: Step-by-step log extraction and data decoding.
3. **Hands-On Activity**: Students analyze sample drone logs using Python scripts.
4. **Discussion**: Ethical considerations and future applications of drone forensics.

## Preparation
To get the most out of this session, ensure you have:
- Python installed on your laptop (version 3.x recommended).
- Google Earth or a similar mapping tool (optional for visualization).

## Why This Matters
As drones become integral to industries like logistics and surveillance, forensic capabilities are critical for investigating incidents and ensuring accountability.
